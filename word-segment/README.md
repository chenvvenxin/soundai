here are two py_files
WSS_compile.py is for idle to debug,for it will generate a txt_file named 'temp' in the same folder.
WSS.py is used to generate a exe_file.Using cmd by "pyinstaller -F -w -i S.ico WSS.py",u can get a transplantable and encapsulated program。
But attention,this program can only run in the network "Soundai" ：）
